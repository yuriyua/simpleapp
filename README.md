Implement a simple app, which -

1. Allows user to sign up and log in through Gmail
2. After authenticating, it fetches all Gmail contacts of the user
3. It redirects back to the app
4. Displays all fetched Gmail Contacts of user, with details like Name, Phone Number, Email IDs
5. Displays most frequently/recently communicated contacts.
6. Gets information from user's calendar to show all the people user has met recently/frequently.
7. User should be able to search for his contacts.

Implement the feature using CakePHP and MySQL.
Host your app online - we would like to check it out as a user; you can host on openshift (it's free) or any other hosting site of your choice.
Also, host the code for this on Github and share it with us.
